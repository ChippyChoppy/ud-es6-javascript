/**
 * Map helper in practical programming
 * 
 * by far one of most commonly used in frontend development
 * 
 *      A lot of the job is just rendering lists of data
 * 
 * Take each object representing a post and transform it to something appearing on the screen
 * 
 * map over the array, we're not going to mutate the array, instead we'll take info from the objects and put it on the screen
