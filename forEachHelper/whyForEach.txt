Why would we ever have practical use of forEach?

* swiss army knife of array helpers
    almost every other helper could be implemented by using forEach

* example: email 
    * looking at spam folder
    * select some --> press delete all selected
    * sends request to server to tell it to delete these emails
        * clicking email sends it to an array to be deleted
            emails.forEach(function(email) {
                deleteEmail(email)
            })
        ** Whenever you want to call some method multiple times w/ diff arg each time, consider forEach
